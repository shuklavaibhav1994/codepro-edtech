# CodePro EdTech Assignment

## Problem Statement:

CodePro is an EdTech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round. 
It used the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business. The major cost that the company is incurring is the customer acquisition cost (CAC).

At the initial stage, customer acquisition cost is required to be high in companies. But as their businesses grow, these companies start focussing on profitability. Many companies first offer their services for free or provide offers at the initial stages but later start charging customers for these services. For example, Google Pay used to provide many offers, and Reliance Jio in India offered free mobile data services for over a year. Once these brands were established and brand awareness was generated, these businesses started growing organically. At this point, they began charging customers.

We had to weed out junk leads from our system. The sales executives are calling potential leads; however, several of them are turning out to be junk leads. This is leading to the wastage of the companyâ€™s time and resources. Hence, the business objective is to improve the efficiency of the sales process, i.e., to increase L2AC. Data science team discussed that we can predict the L2AC flag using the origin of the leads and how they are interacting with the platform.
